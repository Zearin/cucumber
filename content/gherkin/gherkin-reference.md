# Reference

This is the general reference for all Cucumber implementations. Please refer to
the [[documentation overview]] for links to platform-specific documentation.

## Gherkin

Cucumber executes your `.feature` files, and those files contain executable
specifications written in a language called Gherkin.

Gherkin is plain-text English (or one of 60+ other languages) with a little
extra structure. Gherkin is designed to be easy to learn by non-programmers,
yet structured enough to allow concise description of examples to illustrate
business rules in most real-world domains.


Here is a sample Gherkin document:

```gherkin
Feature: Refund item

  Scenario: Jeff returns a faulty microwave
    Given Jeff has bought a microwave for $100
    And he has a receipt
    When he returns the microwave
    Then Jeff should be refunded $100
```

In Gherkin, each line that isn't blank must start with a Gherkin *keyword*,
followed by any text you like. 

The main keywords are:

- `Feature`
- `Scenario`
- `Given`, `When`, `Then`, `And`, `But`  (Steps)
- `Background`
- `Scenario Outline`
- `Examples`

There are a few extra keywords as well:

- `"""` (Doc Strings)
- `|` (Data Tables)
- `@` (Tags)
- `#` (Comments)


### Feature

A `.feature` file is supposed to describe a single feature of the system, or a
particular aspect of a feature. It's just a way to provide a high-level description
of a software feature, and to group related Scenarios.

A Feature has three basic elements:

1. the `Feature:` keyword,
2. a *name* (on the same line),
3. and optionally (but highly recommended), a *description*, which can span multiple lines.

Cucumber does not care about the name or the description. Their purpose is simply
to document important aspects of the Feature, such as a brief explanation and a 
list of business rules (general acceptance criteria).

Here is an example:

```gherkin
Feature: Refund item

  Sales assistants should be able to refund customers' purchases.
  This is required by the law, and is also essential in order to
  keep customers happy.

  Rules:
  - Customer must present proof of purchase
  - Purchase must be less than 30 days ago
```

In addition to a *name* and a *description*, Features contain a list of [Scenarios](#Scenario)
or [Scenario Outlines](#Scenario-outlines), and an optional [Background](#background).

### Descriptions

Some parts of Gherkin documents do not have to start with a keyword.

On the lines following a `Feature`, `Scenario`, `Scenario Outline` or `Examples`
you can write anything you like, as long as no line starts with a keyword.

### Scenario

A Scenario is a *concrete example* that *illustrates* a business rule. It consists of
a list of [Steps](#Steps).

You can have as many Steps as you like, but we recommend you keep the number at 3â€“5 per Scenario.
If they become longer, they lose their expressive power as specification and documentation.

In addition to being a specification and documentation, a Scenario is also a *test*.
As a whole, your Scenarios are an *executable specification* of the system.

Scenarios follow the same pattern:

- Describe an initial context
- Describe an event
- Describe an expected outcome

This is accomplished with Steps.

### Steps

A Step typically starts with `Given`, `When` or `Then`. If there are multiple
`Given` or `When` Steps underneath each other, you can use `And` or `But`.


Cucumber does not differentiate between the keywords, but choosing the right
one is important for the readability of the Scenario as a whole.

#### Given

`Given` Steps are used to describe the initial context of the system---the
*scene* of the Scenario. It is typically something that happened in the *past*.


When Cucumber executes a `Given` Step, it will configure the system to be in a
well-defined state, such as creating and configuring objects or adding data to
the test database.


It's okay to have several `Given` Steps. To keep them readable, simply use 
`And` or `But` instead of `Given` after the first one.


#### When

`When` Steps are used to describe an event, or an *action*. This can be a
person interacting with the system, or it can be an event triggered by another
system.

It's strongly recommended you only have a single `When` Step per Scenario. If
you feel compelled to add more, it's usually a sign that you should split the
Scenario up into multiple Scenarios.


#### Then

`Then` Steps are used to describe an *expected* outcome, or result.

The [Step Definition](/cucumber/Step-definitions/) of a `Then` Step should use
an *assertion* to compare the *actual* outcome (what the system actually does)
to the *expected* outcome (what the Step says the system is supposed to do).


### Background

Occasionally you'll find yourself repeating the same `Given` Steps in all of
the Scenarios in a Feature file. Since it is repeated in every Scenario it is
an indication that those Steps are not *essential* to describe the Scenarios,
they are *incidental details*.


You can literally move such `Given` Steps to the Background. Simply group them 
under a `Background` section before the first Scenario:

```gherkin
Background:
  Given a $100 microwave was sold on 2015-11-03
  And today is 2015-11-18
```

## Scenario Outlines

Copying and pasting Scenarios to use different values quickly becomes tedious 
and repetitive:

```gherkin
Scenario: eat 5 out of 12
  Given there are 12 cucumbers
  When I eat 5 cucumbers
  Then I should have 7 cucumbers

Scenario: eat 5 out of 20
  Given there are 20 cucumbers
  When I eat 5 cucumbers
  Then I should have 15 cucumbers
```

Scenario Outlines allow more concise expression of these examples through the
use of a template with placeholders, using `Scenario Outline`, `Examples` with
tables and `< >` delimited parameters:

```gherkin
Scenario Outline: eating
  Given there are <start> cucumbers
  When I eat <eat> cucumbers
  Then I should have <left> cucumbers

  Examples:
    | start | eat | left |
    |  12   |  5  |  7   |
    |  20   |  5  |  15  |
```

A Scenario Outline's Steps provide a template which is never directly run. A
Scenario Outline is run once for each row in the `Examples` section beneath it
(not counting the first row).

The way this works is via placeholders. Placeholders must be contained within
`< >` in the Scenario Outline's Steps. For example:

```gherkin
Given <I'm a placeholder and I'm ok>
```

The placeholders indicate that when the Examples row is run they should be
substituted with real values from the `Examples` table. If a placeholder name
is the same as a column title in the `Examples` table then this is the value
that will replace it.

You can also use placeholders in [[Multiline Step Arguments]].

**IMPORTANT:** *Your Step definitions will never have to match a placeholder. They will need to match the _values_ that will _replace_ the placeholder.*

So when running the first row of our example:

```gherkin
Examples:
  | start | eat | left |
  |  12   |  5  |  7   |
```

The Scenario that is actually run is:

```gherkin
Scenario Outline: eating
  Given there are 12 cucumbers      # <start> replaced with 12
  When I eat 5 cucumbers            # <eat> replaced with 5
  Then I should have 7 cucumbers    # <left> replaced with 7
```

While `Scenario outlines` help minimize redundancy, they aren't necessarily easier to read from a business or narrative perspective. Remember to choose `Examples` that illustrate something new about the `Feature`.

One way to ensure that your `Examples` are contributing to the full picture of the `Feature` is to break them into multiple tables. Whenever possible, include plain-text descriptions of the underlying rules and break the examples up to illustrate these rules.

Here is an example from [The Cucumber Book](https://pragprog.com/book/hwcuc/the-cucumber-book) (p.74):

```gherkin
Feature: Account Creation
Scenario Outline: Password validation
  Given I try to create an account with password "<Password>"
  Then I should see that the password is <Valid or Invalid>

  Examples:
  | Password | Valid or Invalid |
  | abc      | invalid          |
  | ab1      | invalid          |
  | abc1     | valid            |
  | abcd     | invalid          |
  | abcd1    | valid            |
```

In this Feature, it isn't clear why certain passwords are valid or invalid. 

By reformatting the examples into two tables with descriptive text, the Scenario Outline becomes much more effective (p.75):

```gherkin
Feature: Account Creation
Scenario Outline: Password validation
  Given I try to create an account with password "<Password>"
  Then I should see that the password is <Valid or Invalid>

  Examples: Too Short
    Passwords are invalid if less than 4 characters

    | Password | Valid or Invalid |
    | abc      | invalid          |
    | ab1      | invalid          |

  Examples: Letters and Numbers
    Passwords need both letters and numbers to be valid

    | abc1     | valid            |
    | abcd     | invalid          |
    | abcd1    | valid            |
```
