# Reference

This is the general reference for all Cucumber implementations. Please refer to
the [[documentation overview]] for links to platform-specific documentation.

## Gherkin

Cucumber executes your `.feature` files, and those files contain executable
specifications written in a language called Gherkin.

Gherkin is plain-text English (or one of 60+ other languages) with a little
extra structure. Gherkin is designed to be easy to learn by non-programmers,
yet structured enough to allow concise description of examples to illustrate
business rules in most real-world domains.


Here is a sample Gherkin document:

```gherkin
Feature: Refund item

  Scenario: Jeff returns a faulty microwave
    Given Jeff has bought a microwave for $100
    And he has a receipt
    When he returns the microwave
    Then Jeff should be refunded $100
```

In Gherkin, each line that isn't blank must start with a Gherkin *keyword*,
followed by any text you like. 

The main keywords are:

- `Feature`
- `Scenario`
- `Given`, `When`, `Then`, `And`, `But`  (Steps)
- `Background`
- `Scenario Outline`
- `Examples`

There are a few extra keywords as well:

- `"""` (Doc Strings)
- `|` (Data Tables)
- `@` (Tags)
- `#` (Comments)


### Feature

A `.feature` file is supposed to describe a single feature of the system, or a
particular aspect of a feature. It's just a way to provide a high-level description
of a software feature, and to group related Scenarios.

A Feature has three basic elements:

1. the `Feature:` keyword,
2. a *name* (on the same line),
3. and optionally (but highly recommended), a *description*, which can span multiple lines.

Cucumber does not care about the name or the description. Their purpose is simply
to document important aspects of the Feature, such as a brief explanation and a 
list of business rules (general acceptance criteria).

Here is an example:

```gherkin
Feature: Refund item

  Sales assistants should be able to refund customers' purchases.
  This is required by the law, and is also essential in order to
  keep customers happy.

  Rules:
  - Customer must present proof of purchase
  - Purchase must be less than 30 days ago
```

In addition to a *name* and a *description*, Features contain a list of [Scenarios](#Scenario)
or [Scenario Outlines](#Scenario-outlines), and an optional [Background](#background).

### Descriptions

Some parts of Gherkin documents do not have to start with a keyword.

On the lines following a `Feature`, `Scenario`, `Scenario Outline` or `Examples`
you can write anything you like, as long as no line starts with a keyword.

### Scenario

A Scenario is a *concrete example* that *illustrates* a business rule. It consists of
a list of [Steps](#Steps).

You can have as many Steps as you like, but we recommend you keep the number at 3–5 per Scenario.
If they become longer, they lose their expressive power as specification and documentation.

In addition to being a specification and documentation, a Scenario is also a *test*.
As a whole, your Scenarios are an *executable specification* of the system.

Scenarios follow the same pattern:

- Describe an initial context
- Describe an event
- Describe an expected outcome

This is accomplished with Steps.

### Steps

A Step typically starts with `Given`, `When` or `Then`. If there are multiple
`Given` or `When` Steps underneath each other, you can use `And` or `But`.


Cucumber does not differentiate between the keywords, but choosing the right
one is important for the readability of the Scenario as a whole.

#### Given

`Given` Steps are used to describe the initial context of the system---the
*scene* of the Scenario. It is typically something that happened in the *past*.


When Cucumber executes a `Given` Step, it will configure the system to be in a
well-defined state, such as creating and configuring objects or adding data to
the test database.


It's okay to have several `Given` Steps. To keep them readable, simply use 
`And` or `But` instead of `Given` after the first one.


#### When

`When` Steps are used to describe an event, or an *action*. This can be a
person interacting with the system, or it can be an event triggered by another
system.

It's strongly recommended you only have a single `When` Step per Scenario. If
you feel compelled to add more, it's usually a sign that you should split the
Scenario up into multiple Scenarios.


#### Then

`Then` Steps are used to describe an *expected* outcome, or result.

The [Step Definition](/cucumber/Step-definitions/) of a `Then` Step should use
an *assertion* to compare the *actual* outcome (what the system actually does)
to the *expected* outcome (what the Step says the system is supposed to do).


### Background

Occasionally you'll find yourself repeating the same `Given` Steps in all of
the Scenarios in a Feature file. Since it is repeated in every Scenario it is
an indication that those Steps are not *essential* to describe the Scenarios,
they are *incidental details*.


You can literally move such `Given` Steps to the Background. Simply group them 
under a `Background` section before the first Scenario:

```gherkin
Background:
  Given a $100 microwave was sold on 2015-11-03
  And today is 2015-11-18
```

## Scenario Outlines

Copying and pasting Scenarios to use different values quickly becomes tedious 
and repetitive:

```gherkin
Scenario: eat 5 out of 12
  Given there are 12 cucumbers
  When I eat 5 cucumbers
  Then I should have 7 cucumbers

Scenario: eat 5 out of 20
  Given there are 20 cucumbers
  When I eat 5 cucumbers
  Then I should have 15 cucumbers
```

Scenario Outlines allow more concise expression of these examples through the
use of a template with placeholders, using `Scenario Outline`, `Examples` with
tables and `< >` delimited parameters:

```gherkin
Scenario Outline: eating
  Given there are <start> cucumbers
  When I eat <eat> cucumbers
  Then I should have <left> cucumbers

  Examples:
    | start | eat | left |
    |  12   |  5  |  7   |
    |  20   |  5  |  15  |
```

A Scenario Outline's Steps provide a template which is never directly run. A
Scenario Outline is run once for each row in the `Examples` section beneath it
(not counting the first row).

The way this works is via placeholders. Placeholders must be contained within
`< >` in the Scenario Outline's Steps. For example:

```gherkin
Given <I'm a placeholder and I'm ok>
```

The placeholders indicate that when the Examples row is run they should be
substituted with real values from the `Examples` table. If a placeholder name
is the same as a column title in the `Examples` table then this is the value
that will replace it.

You can also use placeholders in [[Multiline Step Arguments]].

**IMPORTANT:** *Your Step definitions will never have to match a placeholder. They will need to match the _values_ that will _replace_ the placeholder.*

So when running the first row of our example:

```gherkin
Examples:
  | start | eat | left |
  |  12   |  5  |  7   |
```

The Scenario that is actually run is:

```gherkin
Scenario Outline: eating
  Given there are 12 cucumbers      # <start> replaced with 12
  When I eat 5 cucumbers            # <eat> replaced with 5
  Then I should have 7 cucumbers    # <left> replaced with 7
```

While `Scenario outlines` help minimize redundancy, they aren't necessarily easier to read from a business or narrative perspective. Remember to choose `Examples` that illustrate something new about the `Feature`.

One way to ensure that your `Examples` are contributing to the full picture of the `Feature` is to break them into multiple tables. Whenever possible, include plain-text descriptions of the underlying rules and break the examples up to illustrate these rules.

Here is an example from [The Cucumber Book](https://pragprog.com/book/hwcuc/the-cucumber-book) (p.74):

```gherkin
Feature: Account Creation
Scenario Outline: Password validation
  Given I try to create an account with password "<Password>"
  Then I should see that the password is <Valid or Invalid>

  Examples:
  | Password | Valid or Invalid |
  | abc      | invalid          |
  | ab1      | invalid          |
  | abc1     | valid            |
  | abcd     | invalid          |
  | abcd1    | valid            |
```

In this Feature, it isn't clear why certain passwords are valid or invalid. 

By reformatting the examples into two tables with descriptive text, the Scenario Outline becomes much more effective (p.75):

```gherkin
Feature: Account Creation
Scenario Outline: Password validation
  Given I try to create an account with password "<Password>"
  Then I should see that the password is <Valid or Invalid>

  Examples: Too Short
    Passwords are invalid if less than 4 characters

    | Password | Valid or Invalid |
    | abc      | invalid          |
    | ab1      | invalid          |

  Examples: Letters and Numbers
    Passwords need both letters and numbers to be valid

    | abc1     | valid            |
    | abcd     | invalid          |
    | abcd1    | valid            |
```
